# ⚡ EV Charging Station Optimization System

## 📌 Problem Statement
With the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs), cities are facing challenges in establishing efficient and accessible EV charging infrastructure. Random placement of charging stations leads to:
- Uneven distribution and congestion at certain stations.  
- Long travel distances for users.  
- Poor utilization of available resources.  

This project aims to **develop an AI-driven system to optimize the placement and distribution of EV charging stations** across a city, ensuring accessibility, reducing congestion, and promoting sustainable mobility.

## 🎯 Objective
To design and implement a data-driven optimization model that:
- Analyzes traffic, population, and energy demand data.  
- Identifies potential high-demand zones for new charging stations.  
- Minimizes travel distance between stations and EV users.  
- Supports city planners with a clear, data-backed visualization.

## 🧠 Project Description
The system utilizes **machine learning and geospatial analysis** to recommend ideal locations for EV charging stations.  
It processes datasets containing geographic, demographic, and mobility-related information to:
1. Detect existing station clusters.  
2. Identify underserved regions.  
3. Suggest optimal new locations using clustering and optimization algorithms.

This ensures that EV infrastructure expansion is **efficient, scalable, and sustainable**.
